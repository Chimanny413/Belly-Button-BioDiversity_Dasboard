# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbial species (OTUs) found in human navels. The dashboard enables users to visualize and analyze microbial data for individual samples through dynamic charts and a demographic information panel.

## Features
-  **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Displays the top 10 OTUs for a selected sample, with sample values, OTU IDs, and hoverable OTU labels.
-  **Bubble Chart:** Represents all OTUs for a sample, using bubble size, color, and hover text for intuitive analysis.
-  **Demographic Panel:** Displays metadata such as demographic information for the selected sample.
-  **Dynamic Updates:** All visualizations and metadata update instantly based on user input.
## Technologies Used
-  **JavaScript:** Core programming language for interactivity.
-  **D3.js:** For fetching and manipulating JSON data.
-  **Plotly.js:** To create dynamic and interactive charts.
-  **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the dashboard.
